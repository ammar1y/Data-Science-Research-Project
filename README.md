# Description of the Files

In the following, a description of the files and folders included in this repository is provided.

## "Report.pdf"

This is the current version of the report of this project. It contains documentation and explanation about all steps of this project.

## "Code Notebooks" Folder

This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks that include the code used in this project with its results. 

* `Data Preparation and Exploration.ipynb` notebook contains code used in chapter 4 of the project for data exploration and preparation. You can view the notebook on Google Colab on [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ammar1y/Data-Science-Research-Project/blob/master/Code%20Notebooks/Data%20Preparation%20and%20Exploration.ipynb).

* `Modeling 1 - Model Selection.ipynb` notebook contains code used in chapter 5 for feature selection, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization. You can view the notebook on Google Colab on [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ammar1y/Data-Science-Research-Project/blob/master/Code%20Notebooks/Modeling%201%20-%20Model%20Selection.ipynb).

* `Modeling 2 - Final Model Building.ipynb` notebook contains code used in chapter 5 for building the final ensemble model and  training and testing the final model. You can view the notebook on Google Colab on [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ammar1y/Data-Science-Research-Project/blob/master/Code%20Notebooks/Modeling%202%20-%20Final%20Model%20Building.ipynb).

The data files used by these notebooks are included in the `Code Notebooks` folder. But due to the large size of some files, it wasn't possible to upload them to Github. So we included a small sample of them in this repository. To run the code that use those files, you need to get the complete files. Below is a list of those large files and the links to download them from Googel Cloud Storage:

* `yellow_tripdata_2017-03_processed.csv`. To download the complete version of this file, [click here](https://storage.googleapis.com/research_project_um/yellow_tripdata_2017-03_processed.csv). This file is produced by `Data Preparation and Exploration.ipynb` notebook and it is used by `Modeling 1 - Model Selection.ipynb` and `Modeling 2 - Final Model Building.ipynb` notebooks.

* `yellow_tripdata_2018-03_processed.csv`. To download the complete version of this file, [click here](https://storage.googleapis.com/research_project_um/yellow_tripdata_2018-03_processed.csv). This file is produced by `Data Preparation and Exploration.ipynb` notebook and it is used by `Modeling 1 - Model Selection.ipynb` and `Modeling 2 - Final Model Building.ipynb` notebooks.

* `./NYC_taxi_data/yellow_tripdata_2017-03.csv`. To download the complete version of this file, [click here](https://storage.googleapis.com/research_project_um/yellow_tripdata_2017-03.csv). This file was downloaded originally from NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission website. It is used by `Data Preparation and Exploration.ipynb` notebook.

* `./NYC_taxi_data/yellow_tripdata_2018-03.csv`. To download the complete version of this file, [click here](https://storage.googleapis.com/research_project_um/yellow_tripdata_2018-03.csv). This file was downloaded originally from NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission website. It is used by `Data Preparation and Exploration.ipynb` notebook.

Note: when running the notebooks, you might need to change some of the file paths inside of them to refer to paths on your machine.

## "Flask App" Folder

This folder contains the files of the Flask web application which was built to deploy the model of this project. The app was deployed on Googel App Engine and can be accessed from [this link](https://cohesive-bonbon-246315.appspot.com/).

## "Taxi-trips meta files" Folder

This folder contains some files related to the taxi-trips datasets such as data dictionary file and map files.
